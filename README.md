# SmartPot iOS App

This iOS app connects to the "SmartPot" backend and shows you all the information you need about your plant. 

Some features include:

- a homepage with an overview of all your plants
- an extensive and interactive graphical representation of all the plant data you gathered with your Raspberry Pi
- history of all your plant data at the history tab or for a specific plant at its detail page
- support and display of a webcam image of your plant

## Important

Currently this app uses our specific API endpoint at trabby.at. If you want to change this, you should head to the class `Networkmanager.swift` and take a look at the `enum ApiEndpoints`.
